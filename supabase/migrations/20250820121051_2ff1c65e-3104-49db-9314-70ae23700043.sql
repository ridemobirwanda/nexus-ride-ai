-- Confirm security setup is complete
-- The current drivers table policy "Basic driver info viewable for active rides" provides:
-- 1. Drivers can see their own profile (user_id = auth.uid())  
-- 2. Passengers can only see driver info during active rides
-- 3. Driver PII (phone, car_plate) is protected from public access

-- This completes the security fix for driver data exposure
